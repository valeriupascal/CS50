Goal: To write a program in C that can recover JPEG images from a forensic file.
The program must accept one and only one command line argument, the name of the file the images will be recovered from.
The program should output each of the JPEG images recovered as a separate file. There are 50 in total to be recovered from the card.raw file provided.
